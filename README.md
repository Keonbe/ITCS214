# ITCS214 - Data Structures and Algorithms Lab

## Introduction
This repository contains my Java implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms class at De La Salle University Dasmarinas.
## Overview
The lab activity/repository covers the following core topics:

- Arrays: Basic data structure for storing elements.
  
- Lists: Linear data structures that allow elements to be inserted or removed at any position.
  
- Linked Lists: Linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations.
  
- Stacks: LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure.
  
- Queues: FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure.
  
- Graphs: Non-linear data structures consisting of nodes and edges.
  
- Trees/Binary Trees: Hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes.
