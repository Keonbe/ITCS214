# ITCS214 - Data Structures and Algorithms Lab

## Introduction
This repository contains my Java implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms class at De La Salle University Dasmarinas.
## Overview
The lab activity/repository covers the following core topics:

- Arrays: Basic data structure for storing elements.
  
- Lists: Linear data structures that allow elements to be inserted or removed at any position.
  
- Linked Lists: Linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations.
  
- Stacks: LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure.
  
- Queues: FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure.
  
- Graphs: Non-linear data structures consisting of nodes and edges.
  
- Trees/Binary Trees: Hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes.

### Note:
Specific implementations and problem-solving techniques will be provided during the lab sessions.
The midterm and final exams will assess your understanding of the concepts and your ability to apply them to solve problems.

### **Cloning the Repository**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/keonbe/ITCS214.git
cd your-repo
```

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA and ensure your **Java SDK** is set up under **File > Project Structure > Project**.

## **Troubleshooting**
**Issue:** IntelliJ shows `Decompiled .class file, bytecode version: 61.0 (Java 17)` instead of source code.

**Solution:**
1. In **Project Explorer**, check if your `.java` source files exist under `src/`.
2. If missing, right-click the root directory → **"Mark Directory as" → "Sources Root"**.
3. Restart IntelliJ IDEA and rebuild the project (**Build > Rebuild Project**).

Now, IntelliJ should recognize and compile your Java files correctly.

Contributing Feel free to contribute to this repository by:
- Adding new data structures and algorithms.
- Improving existing implementations.
- Fixing bugs.
